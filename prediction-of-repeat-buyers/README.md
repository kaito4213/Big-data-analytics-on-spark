# Repeat Buyer Prediction for online merchants

## Introduction
Merchants sometimes run big promotions like discounts or cash coupons on
particular dates. Unfortunately, many of the attracted buyers are one-time deal hunters, and these promotions may have little long lasting impact on sales. To alleviate this problem, it is important for merchants to identify who can be converted into repeated buyers.

Data provided by T-mall contains anonymized users' shopping logs in the past 6
months before and on a special sales day,and the label information indicating
whether they are repeated buyers.This project aims to predict which new buyers for given merchants will become loyal customers in the future. In other words, it will predict the probability that these new buyers would purchase items from the same merchants again within 6 months.
