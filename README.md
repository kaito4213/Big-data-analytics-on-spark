- sketches: A sketch is a compact summary of a large amount of data. This file Implemented two sketches, count-min sketch and bloom filter. The Bloom Filter is a data structure that compactly represents a set as a bitmap which is updated via hashing.  The main conceptual different is that CM sketch represents a multiset, and has different assumptions about the kind of updates.  More formally, CM sketch summarizes a frequency distribution, while Bloom Filter is concerned with representing which elements are present in a set.
